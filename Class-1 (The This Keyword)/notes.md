# ✅ JavaScript OOPs – Class 1

## Understanding the `this` Keyword (Master Notes)

---

## Agenda of the Lecture (2 Hours)

### What we will cover today

1. What is `this` in JavaScript (core intuition)
2. The **Golden Rule** of `this`
3. `this` in:

   * Global context
   * Regular functions
   * Object methods
   * Nested functions
4. Browser vs Node.js behavior (non-strict)
5. Strict mode & **why `this` becomes `undefined`**
6. Arrow functions & lexical `this`
7. Common mistakes, real bugs & interview traps
8. Live doubt decoding

> 💡 *Goal of this class: You should be able to predict `this` before running the code.*

---

## 1. What is `this`?

### Definition (Simple but Accurate)

* `this` is a **runtime binding**
* It refers to **the object that is calling the function**
* Its value is **not fixed**
* It is decided **when the function is executed**, not when written

---

## 🔑 The Golden Rule of `this` (MOST IMPORTANT)

> 🧠 **`this` depends on HOW a function is called, not WHERE it is written**

If students remember only this line → **they win JavaScript**

📌 **Only exception:** Arrow Functions
(we’ll explain exactly why later)

---

## 2. `this` in the Global Context

### Browser (non-strict)

```js
console.log(this);
```

✅ Output:

```
window
```

Why?

* In browsers, the global execution context owns the code
* Global object = `window`
* So → `this === window`

---

### Node.js (non-strict)

```js
console.log(this);
```

✅ Output:

```
{}
```

⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**

> In Node.js, **each file is a module**, not a global script
> Top-level `this` === `module.exports`

This single point prevents **90% Node confusion**.

---

## 3. `this` Inside a Regular Function (Non-Strict)

### Browser

```js
function fn() {
  console.log(this);
}
fn();
```

✅ Output:

```
window
```

### Why?

* Function is called **normally**
* No object before the call
* JS uses **default binding**
* Default binding → global object

---

### Node.js

```js
function fn() {
  console.log(this);
}
fn();
```

✅ Output:

```
global
```

---

## 4. `this` Inside an Object Method

```js
const obj = {
  name: "JavaScript",
  showName: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

obj.showName();
```

✅ Output:

```
JavaScript
```

### Why?

* Function is called with **dot notation**
* `this` refers to **object before the dot**

📌 **Rule:**

> `obj.method()` → `this === obj`

---

## 5. Nested Functions (🔥 Real Bug Generator)

```js
const obj = {
  name: "JS",
  fn: function () {
    console.log(this.name); // JS

    function innerFn() {
      console.log(this.name);
    }

    innerFn();
  }
};

obj.fn();
```

### Output:

```
JS
undefined
```

### Explanation (Step-by-step)

* `obj.fn()` → method call → `this === obj`
* `innerFn()` → **plain function call**
* Plain call → default binding → global / undefined

📌 **Important insight:**

> `this` does NOT automatically flow into nested functions

This is why arrow functions became popular.

## 6. Browser vs Node.js (Non-Strict Summary)

| Scenario         | Browser  | Node.js  |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Global `this`    | `window` | `{}`     |
| Regular function | `window` | `global` |
| Object method    | object   | object   |
| Nested function  | global   | global   |

---

## 7. Strict Mode & `this` (VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPT)

Enable strict mode:

```js
"use strict";
```

### Key Change

> ❗ **Strict mode removes default `this` binding**

---

### Example

```js
"use strict";
function fn() {
  console.log(this);
}
fn();
```

✅ Output:

```
undefined
```

---

### 🔍 WHY strict mode does this (CORE EXPLANATION)

Strict mode exists to **prevent accidental global pollution**

#### Non-strict danger:

```js
function update() {
  this.count = 1;
}
update();
```

⛔ Non-strict result:

```js
window.count = 1; // silent global pollution
```

#### Strict mode behavior:

```js
"use strict";
function update() {
  this.count = 1;
}
update();
```

💥 Error:

```
Cannot set properties of undefined
```

📌 **Strict mode refuses to GUESS what `this` should be**

---

### ⚠️ Important Clarification (Common Confusion)

> ❓ *“If strict mode prevents pollution, why is `this` still `window` globally?”*

Because:

✅ **Strict mode blocks IMPLICIT access, not EXPLICIT access**

---

### Global scope in strict mode

```js
"use strict";
console.log(this);
```

✅ Output:

```
window
```

Why this is allowed:

* You are **explicitly** in global execution context
* No guessing is involved
* This is intentional access

---

### Inside functions (the danger zone)

```js
"use strict";
function fn() {
  console.log(this);
}
fn();
```

❌ Output:

```
undefined
```

Because:

* No caller object
* JS refuses to auto-bind to `window`

📌 **Key line for students:**

> Strict mode does NOT block `window`
> It blocks JavaScript from **auto-assigning `this = window`**

---

## 8. Arrow Functions & Lexical `this`

### Arrow functions DO NOT have their own `this`

> They **inherit `this` from the surrounding scope**

This is called **lexical `this`**

---

### Regular method

```js
const obj = {
  name: "JS",
  fn: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
obj.fn();
```

✅ Output:

```
JS
```

---

### Arrow as method (🚨 usually wrong)

```js
const obj = {
  name: "JS",
  fn: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
obj.fn();
```

❌ Output:

```
undefined
```

Why?

* Arrow ignores call-site
* `this` is taken from where it was **defined**
* That scope is global

📌 **Rule of thumb:**

> ❌ Don’t use arrow functions as object methods
> ✅ Use arrows for callbacks & nested functions

## 9. Interview Cheat Sheet (Screenshot-Ready)

| Case              | `this`             |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Global (browser)  | `window`           |
| `fn()` non-strict | global             |
| `fn()` strict     | `undefined`        |
| `obj.method()`    | `obj`              |
| Nested function   | global / undefined |
| Arrow function    | lexical            |

---

## 10. Final Takeaways (Exam + Real World)

1. `this` is decided at **call time**
2. Dot (`.`) decides ownership
3. Strict mode removes dangerous defaults
4. Arrow functions ignore call-site
5. Most bugs come from **nested functions & callbacks**
